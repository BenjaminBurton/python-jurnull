## 1.1 Understanding Python Fundamentals

## Python Syntax: Python Snytax is simple and easy to understand. It uses Indentation to define code blocks

## Example : Hello World! program

```bash
print("Hello, World!")
```


## Varibles and Data Types: Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

## Example : Varibles and Data Types 

```bash

x = 10                                      # integer

y = 3.14                                    # float

name = "John"                               # string

is_student = True                           # boolean


my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]                   # list

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)                        # tuple

my_dict = {"name", "John", "age", 30}       # dictionary

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}                    # set
```


## Basic Operators : Python supports various operators such as arithmetic, comparision, logical, assignment, more


## Example : Basic Operators

```bash
x = 10

y = 3


## Arithmetic Operators

print(x + y)                                # Addition

print(x - y)                                # Subtraction      

print(x * y)                                # Multiplication

print(x / y)                                # Divide

print(x % y)                                # Modulus

print(x ** y)                               # Exponentiation

print(x // y)                               # Floor Division



## Comparision Operators

print(x == y)                               # Equals to False

print(x != y)                               # Not equal to True

print(x > y)                                # Greater than True

print(x < y)                                # Less than False

print(x >= y)                               # Greater than or equal to True

print(x <= y)                               # Less than or equal to False



## Logical Operators

print(x > 5 and y < 10)                     # Logical AND  == True

print(x > 5 or y < 2)                       # Logical OR   == True

print(not(x > 5))                           # Logical NOT  == False



## Assignment Operators

x += 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x + 5

x -= 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x - 5

x *= 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x * 5

x /= 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x / 5
```



## Input and Output : You can take user input and display output using the `input()` and `print()` functions


## Example : Input and Output 

```bash
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```


## Practice, Projects, and Collaboration

### Practice Regularly:

Regular practice is essential for mastering Python. Work on coding challenges, solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal, and try to implement different algorithms and data structures.

### Build Projects:

Building projects is an excellent way to apply your Python skills in real-world scenarios. Start with small projects and gradually increase the complexity. Choose projects that interest you, such as web applications, data analysis tools, automation scripts, or games.

### Collaborate and Seek Feedback:

Collaborating with other developers and seeking feedback on your code can help you improve your skills. Join coding communities, forums, or local meetups to connect with other Python developers. Collaborate on open-source projects or contribute to existing projects to gain practical experience and receive feedback.

### Continuous Learning:

Python is a vast and evolving language, so it's essential to stay updated with the latest developments. Keep exploring new libraries, frameworks, and tools. Read blogs, attend conferences, and participate in online courses to deepen your understanding and stay ahead in your Python journey.
