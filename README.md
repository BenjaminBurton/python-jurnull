# Example : Hello World! program

```bash
print("Hello, World!")
```


# Varibles and Data Types: Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

# Example : Varibles and Data Types 

```bash

x = 10                                      # integer

y = 3.14                                    # float

name = "John"                               # string

is_student = True                           # boolean


my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]                   # list

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)                        # tuple

my_dict = {"name", "John", "age", 30}       # dictionary

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}                    # set
```


# Basic Operators : Python supports various operators such as arithmetic, comparision, logical, assignment, more


# Example : Basic Operators

```bash
x = 10

y = 3


# Arithmetic Operators

print(x + y)                                # Addition

print(x - y)                                # Subtraction      

print(x * y)                                # Multiplication

print(x / y)                                # Divide

print(x % y)                                # Modulus

print(x ** y)                               # Exponentiation

print(x // y)                               # Floor Division



# Comparision Operators

print(x == y)                               # Equals to False

print(x != y)                               # Not equal to True

print(x > y)                                # Greater than True

print(x < y)                                # Less than False

print(x >= y)                               # Greater than or equal to True

print(x <= y)                               # Less than or equal to False



# Logical Operators

print(x > 5 and y < 10)                     # Logical AND  == True

print(x > 5 or y < 2)                       # Logical OR   == True

print(not(x > 5))                           # Logical NOT  == False



# Assignment Operators

x += 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x + 5

x -= 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x - 5

x *= 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x * 5

x /= 5                                      # Equivalent to x = x / 5
```



# Input and Output : You can take user input and display output using the `input()` and `print()` functions


# Example : Input and Output 

```bash
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```
