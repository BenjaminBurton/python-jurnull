# Data Science and Machine Learning: Advanced Python

# NumPy:

# NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

# Example: Using NumPy
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform operations on the array
print("Sum:", np.sum(arr))
print("Mean:", np.mean(arr))
print("Standard Deviation:", np.std(arr))
